To generate the Protocol Buffers objects go to the ../common folder and execute protoc to generate the classes for all
protos under the src/ folder of this module. Alternatively call the makep_java.sh bash script and it will generate all
the protos for you in the correct location (must cd to ../common and run script from there).
