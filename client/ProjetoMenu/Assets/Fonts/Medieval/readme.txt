Thank you for downloading this most medieval of typefaces! Inspiration for this was snatched up from wood engravings and olde world manuscripts of the middle ages thru the 16th century. While very
basic puntucation is present, most of the rest is replaced by symbols, crests, flags, crowns, and several other decorative graphics throughout the era. There are actually two different 
versions: "Your Royal Highness" is similar but omits pretty much 99% of the decorative lines found on the lowercase ascenders and descenders and contains full punctuation. This version is only
available with commercial license.
